# HS-LDZ_badge
Hakierspejs Łódź badge, on which we teach people how to solder.

### Assumptions:

- Simple circuit
- Small number of components
- Relatively short assembly time
- Practical use


  The circuit is an implementation of the LM3909 using discrete components, based on the design from the link below :
